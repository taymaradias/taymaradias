                <p>Currently I am a physics master student about to be graduated at University of SÃ£o Paulo, where, since 2017, I posses a BSc in physics.<br>
                The research conducted through the master degree focused on plasma physics, more specifically on the understanding of the control of the turbulent transport of particles on the edge of plasma in tokamaks reactors by means of analysing a reactors data. </p>
                <p>Presently I am looking forward to engage my first job in the tech industry and apply and enhance my analysis skills. </p>
